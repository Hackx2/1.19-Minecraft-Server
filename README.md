# Basic Minecraft Server
This github was created by HackDev, also known as HackTheAir.
This is a simple Minecraft 1.19 server.

# How To Use
Start the server by pressing Start.Bat. When you run the bat file the server will start, it will open a log where you can op yourself with the /op PLAYERNAME command.

# Updates
- Added Start.Bat File To Start Server
- Added The Eula.txt

# Requirements
- A Windows 10 desktop or server.
- At least 4GB of RAM is recommended.
- A reliable wired network connection.
- A generous Internet bandwidth plan: Minecraft can use up to 100MB per player per hour, so an unlimited bandwidth plan is ideal.
